## Claude Monet
 Claude Monet was a painter who was known as the start of impressionism, which is named after his historically important and famous painting **Impressionism, Sun Rise(1872)**. This painting was severely rejected by most artists at that time and the term "Impressionism" was used derisively. 
> many thought his sweeps of liquid colour looked simply like an unfinished painting

Monet was one of the most famous painters till this day.This is dedicated to some of most famous paintings by Monet, along with the current locations of his paintings which are not in private collection.

## Data Visualization + JavaScript

Painting titles and years are pinpointed on the world map. 
> Click on the red dot to see which painting it is.

For data visualization, I used React and (map GL)[https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs] and hosted on Vercel. This can be seen from my repo: (monet)[https://github.com/arianoe/monet].
The json data was scraped with Python from this website of (locations of painting collections by Monet)[https://www.cmonetgallery.com/monet-paintings-list.aspx].
