          <p>Claude Monet was a French impressionist painter known for his colorful and atmospheric landscapes. Born in 1840, Monet grew up in Normandy and later moved to Paris where he studied art and became friends with other impressionist painters like Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Edgar Degas.</p>
          <p>Monet's work is characterized by his use of light and color to capture the fleeting effects of the natural world. He is known for his series of paintings depicting the same scene at different times of day, such as his famous "Haystacks" and "Water Lilies" series.</p>
          <p>Monet's paintings often featured scenes of the French countryside, including the gardens at his home in Giverny. He continued to paint and experiment with new techniques until his death in 1926. His work remains highly influential and widely admired.</p>
